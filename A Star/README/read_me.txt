For the A Star assignment I created a theoretical chart explaining how to 
determine the shortest path between 7 nodes with certain connections.

An excel spreadsheet and jpg image have been included to show the specific 
connections that each node has and how the mathematical calculations have 
been made to prove the shortest path.

The values correlating with vector3 coordinates are estimates to show 
proof of concept. Running the program provides a detailed demonstration 
of the characters behavior in the program.
